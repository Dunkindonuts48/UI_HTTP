### BASIC IMPLEMENTATION TASK LIST

üö¢ HTTP Client

The program that interacts as an HTTP client must be able to execute the following features:

Send HTTP requests, in a way that:
* [X] It is possible to choose the URL to which the request will be sent--
* [ ] Use any available HTTP verb in the request (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* [ ] Automatically add the necessary headers to the request so that it can be processed correctly
Add any other arbitrary header desired by the user
Specify the body of the request
Receive and display on screen the response message of the sent request
Inform about the request status
Be able to send successive requests, i.e., to send a second request it is not necessary to restart the program



üèóÔ∏è HTTP Server

The HTTP server must be able to do the following:

Support, at least, the following endpoints, when they are correctly called (correct verb, correct headers...):
An endpoint that returns static content (e.g., a static HTML file)
An endpoint that adds a new resource to the server according to the specified payload
An endpoint that allows viewing a list of resources
An endpoint that allows modifying a resource
An endpoint that allows deleting a resource
Return the appropriate error codes if the endpoints are not invoked correctly
Attend to multiple requests concurrently
Offer minimal configuration that allows choosing on which port the server starts
It is not necessary for the resources to be persisted; they can be managed in memory
